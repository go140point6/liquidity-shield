**What is this server?**  
A monitored environment for observing DeFi liquidity, loans, and related on-chain activity. Discussion and alerts only.

**Is this a financial product or service?**  
No. Nothing here is financial advice, custody, brokerage, or support.

**What data does this system use?**  
Public blockchain data only. All monitoring is performed using publicly visible addresses, contracts, and transactions.

**Will you ever ask me to connect a wallet, sign a transaction, or provide secrets?**  
No. This system will never request: wallet connections, transaction signatures, private keys, seed phrases, or external authentication of any kind.  
If you are asked to sign, connect, or reveal secrets, it is not us.

**Do you operate external websites, dashboards, or support portals?**  
No. There are no official external sites, dashboards, or "help" pages. Any link claiming to be official should be treated as hostile.

**Do you have tokens, NFTs, or airdrops?**  
No. There are no tokens, NFTs, presales, airdrops, or rewards now or in the future. Claims to the contrary are scams.

**What about direct messages (DMs)?**  
Treat unsolicited DMs as hostile by default. This includes messages offering help, asking for verification, claiming urgency, or requesting any action. Staff do not initiate private contact.

**Someone is impersonating staff or copying my name/icon — is that verification?**  
No. Impersonation is expected. Visual similarity is not verification. Server roles and the official @Moderators tag are the only reliable authority signals.

**How do I report suspicious activity or an immediate threat?**  
Report it immediately. Post details in the designated report channel, or tag **@Moderators** for urgent issues. Do not engage, investigate, or reply.

**Why is moderation strict or silent?**  
Silence and restriction are corrective tools intended to reduce risk. They are applied to protect signal integrity, not to debate intent.
